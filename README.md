# SudokuSolver
A program to solve any sudoku.

This was a fun little project to refresh my Java skills over the summer, more of these fun programs will follow.

Use an input file containing a 9x9 grid of numbers with a space in between each number, 0 denotes a blank tile.
I have included a sample text file to show what the input is supposed to look like.
